# Writing for Technical Audiences: A Guide

Many startups and developers write articles hoping to get their community's attention. Most don't get far. They're either about topics that readers don't find interesting, or they're structured in a way that loses the audience. It's dismaying to see these because you can feel how much work people put into them and how disappointed they are when they sink without a trace. What a waste!

Below is advice for writing technical content that resonates with curious, technical audiences. Whether you're writing for Hacker News, Reddit, dev.to, or your own blog, these principles apply.

## The Cardinal Rule: Don't Write Marketing

**If your post reads like marketing or feels like an ad, don't bother.**

Not only will technical readers reject it, you'll train their immune system to reject you. You'll be in the hole, worse than if you hadn't posted anything. The end state you most want to avoid is "This is just an ad."

### What reads like marketing?

Anything written not for its own sake, not because you personally found it interesting, but to produce something you hope other people will like and then do what you want them to do. This is the kiss of death. Technical readers smell it in the parts per million. Their fingers twitch on the downvote button just waiting for it.

### What to do instead?

The people who actually did the work should write about what they did, and they should write what they personally find interesting. **Intellectual curiosity is the currency of technical communities.** You can't fake it, nothing can substitute for it, and you can only be sure you have it when you yourself personally feel it.

When you genuinely feel curious, it's contagious: the reader will resonate at your frequency and may get curious where they'd never have bothered before. It's also contagious when you don't: readers quickly pick up that it's all just a means to an end.

## Write Peer-to-Peer

Communication that works in technical communities is peer-to-peer. Don't write for some abstract customer or user that you hope exists out there. Nobody talks to their friends the way they would talk to customers—it would come across as fake.

Your readers might *become* customers or users, but you won't get there by talking to them that way. If you try to sell the reader, they will get bored and close the tab, or get annoyed and start poking holes. Instead, you should *interest* them, then let them sell themselves.

**Write for yourself, or imagine a friend that you're meeting up for drinks, who has no idea what you've been working on, but is smart, curious, and asks good questions.**

## Show Your Messy Reality

Never try to wrap a shiny surface around your messy reality. Technical readers want an *inside* view—behind the curtain, under the hood. They can feel it when something's hidden from them, and they hate that feeling.

Find something interesting *within* your messy reality, then express it in a not-too-polished way. Your messy reality is much more interesting than any shiny surface. Simply not making this mistake will put you in the 90th percentile.

## Structure Your Content

### 1. Walk the Reader Into Your World

Don't assume people know who you are, what you do, and what problem you solve. No matter how often you've said something on the internet, the set of people who heard it has measure zero.

Follow a stateless protocol: with each message, bootstrap your world from scratch. Make an article-specific intro that leads straight to the problem: 

> "FooCo is an X that does Y. Our users are Z. Because of that, we have to deal with W."

Now you've walked the reader from nothing up to the problem you're about to delve into.

**Ruthlessly cut all fluff from this intro.** Don't go on about your vision or who you want to empower or what your values are. All that crowds out the interesting stuff and readers will hear it as just-another-startup-ad.

### 2. Make the Problem Interesting

A common mistake is to give only a quick description of the problem before jumping into how you solve it. This loses readers who don't know about the problem or why they should care.

**The problem section is the fueling stage that energizes the reader for the journey.**

To make the problem interesting, communicate three things:
1. **What is it?** (Use concrete examples)
2. **Why does it matter?** (What pain does it cause?)
3. **What makes it hard?** (Why isn't it already solved?)

Abstract descriptions are risky: they make sense to people already immersed in your world but are usually a closed, slippery surface to everyone else. Clear examples will give your readers the satisfying click of "ah-I-get-it."

Make it vivid. You want the reader to put themselves in your position and think "if I had that problem I'd sure need to solve it, and yeah, I can see how hard it might be."

### 3. Tell a Story, Not a Tutorial

**Tutorials focus on *how* at the expense of *what* and *why* and *who*.**

Nobody reads tutorials for curiosity or fun. They're valuable when you have a specific task, but then you google it and spend as little time as you can. A good technical story, on the other hand, gratifies the curiosity of a random smart reader.

Frame your material as a story: "We needed to do X so we tried Y, had trouble because of Z, solved it with W, and oh by the way have some surprising details A, B, and C."

Don't say "what you, the reader, should do" (that's condescending), but rather "what we, your humble narrators, actually did, warts and all."

**A story should be about something hard.** Unexpected obstacles and twists make it better. Easy equals boring. No one comes to read about easy things.

## What Makes Content Interesting

### Under the Hood Complexity

Slick 1-2-3 or single-click solutions fail to excite interest when presented as "you barely have to do anything, isn't it great!" This is a turn-off to technical readers who want to know the under-the-hood complexities.

As a *user*, they'll love simplicity. But as a *reader*, if all you present is your smooth surface, curiosity is frustrated. Pull back the curtain, open the hood, give the details.

One way to do this: talk about the complex path you followed before you could make things simple. Show how hard it was to make easy. False starts, unexpected disasters, and everything that makes a problem harder than it seemed—all that adds to an interesting story.

### Real People, Real Voice

Articles written by people who "suck at writing" work far better than content produced by content-producers. Real people writing in their own voice—be it laconic or naive or curmudgeonly or whatever—about real work on some hard technical or business problem has perennial appeal.

If you add blogginess, evangelism, or professionalism, you're spending money to make it worse. Fancy web design makes things worse too: it visually classifies you with the many professional-looking sites that have nothing interesting to say.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Self-Flattery
Resist the temptation. If you say nice things about yourselves or your product, you're singing in the key of marketing and losing the reader as a peer. Grand claims and superlatives (fastest, biggest, first, best) are especially weak.

Turn this to your advantage by using modest language and being cheerfully self-critical. Then the only way people can make objections is to find something nice to say about you!

### 2. The Bait-and-Switch
Never bring up your startup only at the end of an article. To readers this feels like "actually this has been an ad all along." They trusted you and you betrayed them.

The opposite is also a mistake: mention your company too much and your post will sound like an ad. Worst is referring to your company in the third person. Nobody talks that way to peers.

**Just be aboveboard.** Bring up your company at the beginning by briefly explaining what you do and how it relates to the interesting problem. Use your company name sparingly, write in the first person ("I", "we"), and don't try to brand the reader.

### 3. Enterprise Marketing Language
Phrases like "your people can use our product" or "they don't have to be retrained" are fatal. The minute readers realize they're reading enterprise marketing material, they close the tab.

Instead of a customer-corporate dialog, you want a technical-personal dialog. Talk to readers as fellow engineers and entrepreneurs, not as prospective customers or users.

### 4. The Word "Sophisticated"
Saying your technology is "sophisticated" lands as: "we're smarter than you, so don't worry about how we do magic which you couldn't possibly understand." 

Show readers you respect them intellectually by giving them substance about the hard problem and unexpected aspects of the solution.

## The Right Mindset

Talk to your audience the way you would talk to smart friends you haven't seen in a long time, who you're catching up with over beers, who want to hear about what you're working on and ask good questions.

You know the kind of friend who starts turning your problem over in their head the minute you begin telling them about it? That's your reader, except they fill out the whole spectrum of experience and knowledge, from naive at one end to expert in your problem space at the other.

## Summary

- Write from genuine curiosity, not to achieve an outcome
- Be peer-to-peer, not company-to-customer
- Show messy reality, not shiny surfaces
- Tell stories about hard problems, not tutorials
- Use real voices, not professional content
- Be modest and self-critical
- Respect your reader's intelligence
- Give technical depth and unexpected details

Remember: **Intellectual curiosity is the currency.** You can't fake it, and when you genuinely have it, it's contagious.
